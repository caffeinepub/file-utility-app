  "summary": "The diff modifies backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The main.mo file is truncated, so the presence of the http_request_update handler cannot be fully confirmed from the visible portion. The visible portion of main.mo does not show the /webhook/urpay handler implementation, though it may exist in the truncated section. The project_state.json update appears to be a version/summary update. No frontend files were modified, satisfying that constraint.",

      "requirement": "Add a public HTTP interface handler (http_request_update or equivalent) in backend/main.mo that responds to POST requests at /webhook/urpay with HTTP 200 OK and empty body.",
      "reason": "The visible portion of the backend/main.mo diff does not show the http_request_update function or any /webhook/urpay route handler. The file is truncated, so it is possible the implementation exists beyond the truncation point, but there is no visible evidence of it being added.",
