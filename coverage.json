This must be implemented as an `http_request_update` (or equivalent ICP HTTP gateway handler) so the canister accepts and acknowledges the incoming POST from urpay. No payload parsing, no business logic, and no state changes are required — the sole purpose is to return a 200 OK response so the endpoint can be verified as reachable.",
