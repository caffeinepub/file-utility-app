When the backend returns an error (trap) indicating unauthorized access, render a centered message displaying 'Access denied. Admin only.' instead of the verifications list. Maintain the existing immediate fetch on mount and approve controls for authorized admins. The component should gracefully handle the authorization trap from the backend and present a clear denial screen to non-admin users."
