      "text": "In `backend/main.mo`, add a public HTTP interface handler that responds to POST requests at the path `/webhook/urpay` with a 200 OK status and an empty body. This must be implemented as an `http_request_update` (or equivalent ICP HTTP gateway handler) so the canister accepts and acknowledges the incoming POST from urpay. No payload parsing, no business logic, and no state changes are required — the sole purpose is to return a 200 OK response so the endpoint can be verified as reachable.",
